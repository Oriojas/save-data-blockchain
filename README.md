# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract, app for save data in the blockchain, [🏗 Scaffold-ETH](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/getting-started/quick-start) beautiful project:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

📈 Edit your graph `subgraph.yaml` in `packages/subgraph/subgraph.yaml` 

📈 Edit your graph query `schema.graphql` in `packages/subgraph/src/schema.graphql`

📈 Edit your graph ts `mapping.ts` in `packages/subgraph/src/mapping.ts`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

# 📚 Documentation


This a small application save shipping data (for a small fee 🤓) to the blockchain and can be consulted with [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/en/)

## Local deploy
User master branch in [save-data-blockchain](https://github.com/Oriojas/save-data-blockchain.git) and follow the instructions [The Graph Scaffold-eth | Docs](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/toolkit/infrastructure/the-graph), deploy a local graph in you PC and query data save in local in the chain of HardHat (requires install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)):

* Step 1: Clean up previous data:

```bash
yarn clean-graph-node
```

* Step 2: Spin up a local graph node by running (this may take a few minutes)

```bash
yarn run-graph-node
```

* Step 3: Create your local subgraph by running

```bash
yarn graph-create-local
```

* Step 4: Deploy your local subgraph by running

```bash
yarn graph-ship-local
```

And your graph is running:

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
